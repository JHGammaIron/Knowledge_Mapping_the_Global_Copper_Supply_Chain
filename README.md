This project seeks to shed light on the global copper supply chain, serving as a
resource and starting point to attaining supply chain transparency. This project
examined existing public and proprietary datasets, such as the UN Comtrade
database, and combined it with other datasets, such as the FinePrint and ICSG
databases to develop certain graphical and analytical models. By joining various
datasets covering different types of copper flows, some at the more broad
country level, others at the more local facility level, we were able to examine
copper flows at varying geospatial granularities. The final product consisted
of the development of several visualizations and a probabilistic matrix documenting
copper flows across temporal and geographical spaces, at varying levels 
of abstraction.
